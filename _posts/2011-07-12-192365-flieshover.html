<p>I've been trying for over a week to get some pictures of these buggers. They recently turned up in our garden but they move so quickly it's been very hard to get anything decent. On Monday, though, I think I got the best I'm going to be able to, at least for now. I might try again some other time, but for now I'm fairly happy with these.</p>

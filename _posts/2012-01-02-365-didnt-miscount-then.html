<p>I'm very pleased the project is over. As much fun as it was (and it really was, despite some moaning I may have done on here), in the last couple of months it sometimes felt less like fun and more like a chore. Still, I'm really glad I did it. I'm definitely going to keep taking photos and I'll probably continue to take my camera everywhere with me. I might even post some of the results on here, probably a lot less frequently than I did in 2011, though.</p>

<p>Anyway, below are a couple more photos I took on day 365.</p>

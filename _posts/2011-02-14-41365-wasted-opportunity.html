  Wondering around on Thursday, looking for something to photograph, I came
  across a deserted block of flats with an open door on the ground floor.
  Considering how potentially photogenic the labyrinth of corridors inside was,
  I'm incredibly disappointed that I didn't manage to get a single decent photo.

<p>I must go back and try again.</p>

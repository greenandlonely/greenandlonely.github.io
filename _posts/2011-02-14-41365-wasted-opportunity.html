<p>Wondering around on Thursday, looking for something to photograph, I came across a deserted block of flats with an open door on the ground floor. Considering how potentially photogenic the labyrinth of corridors inside was, I'm incredibly disappointed that I didn't manage to get a single decent photo.</p>

<p>I must go back and try again.</p>

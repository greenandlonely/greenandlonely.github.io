<p>After a request from a guy on a Radiohead forum, last week I took lots of pictures of the King of Limbs newspaper album for a short report he was producing for Swiss TV. The brief was to take photos of the individual elements (vinyl, CD, artwork and newspaper) from above. <q>Nothing fancy... i.e. not slanted; no angles</q>, I believe were his words.</p>
<p>Anyway, it has now been on TV and, if you want, you can <a href="http://www.videoportal.sf.tv/video?id=23a351cf-2b6b-4273-a1d0-4b3475be10e5">watch it here</a>. The photos are mostly near the start and near the end. I had to take them outside to take advantage of the evening light, so you'll notice our paving stones in some of the shots. I kind of assumed he'd crop those out, but what the hell.</p>

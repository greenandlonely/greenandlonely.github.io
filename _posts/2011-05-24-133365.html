<p>I'm quite pleased with this one; I like the light on the wheelchair. Mostly I like it because I was walking around Birmingham at lunch time, not getting any photos I liked, and I just happened to look in through a broken window of an abandoned building and spot it.</p>

<p>Although I'm sure I'm not, it's cool when it feels like I might be the only person who's noticed something.</p>

<p>Spent Sunday afternoon with Jasper on a photowalk around some of the less trodden parts of Birmingham. He knows loads about photography and it was great to talk about that stuff and get advice from him. He's also really good at spotting cool photo opportunities, which you'll notice if you read <a href="http://jspr.tndy.me/" title="Jasper Tandy's blog">his blog</a>. Which you should.</p>

<p>As is the norm when I post more than one, the top one is my photo of the day. I'm quite pleased with them all, but I chose that one because I think it'll look the best as a thumbnail next to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/greenandlonely/sets/72157625721016426/" title="365 - my set on Flickr">the rest of them</a>.</p>
<p>Have you subscribed to Jasper's RSS feed yet? Why the fuck not?</p>

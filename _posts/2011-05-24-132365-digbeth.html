<p>I stopped in Digbeth on my way home from work on Thursday and spotted about 10 future photo opportunities, including this.</p>

<a class="post__img--portrait" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/greenandlonely/5714402938" title="132/365 by James Clarke, on Flickr"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3184/5714402938_77a28a96bf_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="132/365"></a>

<p>I'd originally planned on using another, better, photo for my 365 but I liked the light on this when I walked past, so this one it is. I can always go back and get my first choice again another day.</p>

<p>The hundredth day, what better time to start using my new extension tubes? I had a number of issues with my original, 7-quid-from-Amazon tubes, so on pay day I bought myself the more expensive Kenko set.</p>

<p>So far, so good, I guess. It's really difficult though. Next purchase: either a shutter remote control or a tripod that doesn't shake like mad when the shutter is pressed.</p>

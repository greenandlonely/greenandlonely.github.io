<p>This is Flyin' Ryan, a motorcycle stunt man, at a show he was doing in Redditch. My Dad had lent me his telephoto lens, which turned out to be quite useful because they had set up safety barriers really far away from the ramp. It wasn't easy, partially because the lens is manual focus only, but I got these 2 that I was quite pleased with.</p>

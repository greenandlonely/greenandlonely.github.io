<p>After several weeks and what seemed like tonnes of holiday brochures, we finally booked our holiday today. At the end of September, Steph and I fly to Kenya for two weeks! We're staying in a hotel on the coast for a couple of days, going on a 3 night safari in the Tsavo East &amp; Tsavo West National Parks, then it's back to the hotel for the rest of the holiday. I think it's fair to say I haven't been this excited in years.</p>

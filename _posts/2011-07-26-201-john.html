<p>I've been thinking about doing a 100 Strangers project for a little while, as a way to get me more confident in both taking pictures of people and also approaching them to ask if I can do it in the first place.</p>
<p>John asking me for some spare change seemed like a good opportunity to start (he approached me after all), and in the end he was happy for me to take his picture.</p>

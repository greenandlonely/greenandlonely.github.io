<p>I'd been threatening it for quite a while. So, during the Christmas break, with <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bryter-Layter-Nick-Drake/dp/B000025H0Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1297340863&sr=1-1" title="Bryter Latyer on Amazon">Nick Drake</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mirrored-Battles/dp/B000OLHGBQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1297340916&sr=1-1" title="Mirrored on Amazon">Battles</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sigur-Ros-Agaetis-Byrjun/dp/B00004W3MS/ref=sr_1_4?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1297341147&sr=1-4" title="Agaetis Byrjun on Amazon">Sigur Ros</a> for company and Dr. Pepper for fuel, I finally re-designed the site.</p>
<p>I kind of just copied my favourite bits from a number of Wordpress sites and themes I'd seen, so if you think you recognise any parts of it, you're probably right.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think. It's not 100% done, but I decided that putting incomplete work live would act as the initiative I need in order to get it finished. That being said, I'm quite pleased it's got this far; the original design was only supposed to be there temporarily and it lasted for the best part of 2 years!</p>

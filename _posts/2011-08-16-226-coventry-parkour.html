title: '226: Coventry parkour'

<p>There's something I really love about walking around with a camera, trying to find stuff to take photos of. It can lead to some cool, spontaneous meetings with people I otherwise wouldn't have come across.</p>

<p>Tudor and Payam are two of the friendliest people I've met in a while and following them around Coventry was a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon. That town seems like the perfect place for parkour.</p>

<p>Kind of fucked up the processing of some of these - I'm using Fireworks for PC this week for a couple of stupid reasons, and I can't get it to do what I want most of the time. I took some other photos around Coventry that I might post a bit later, but definitely not until I'm back on Aperture.</p>

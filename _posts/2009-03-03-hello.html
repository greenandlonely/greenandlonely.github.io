<p>I was a bit unhappy about being one of the only Web developers who didn't have an up-to-date website, so... tah-dah! Welcome, friend(s). Have a look around if you want, although I'm afraid you won't find much at the moment. Sorry for the lack of content right now but I'll slowly start adding new stuff and a few bells and whistles here and there, just as soon as I decide exactly what I want to do with the site.</p>

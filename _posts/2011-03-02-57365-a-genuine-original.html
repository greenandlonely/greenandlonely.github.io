<p>On day 57 (Saturday to you) I went for a trip to the village of Tanworth-in-Arden to take some photos and visit the grave of - and what appears to be becoming a small shrine to - the excellent Nick Drake. Ever since I was introduced to his music the album Bryter Layter has been one of my favourites and it's truly sad that he died before getting the recognition he deserved.</p>

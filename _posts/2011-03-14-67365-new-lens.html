<p>Lots of catching up to do as far as the 365 project goes. To start with, this is the sort of macro lens I bought. It's not a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nikon-105MM-F2-8D-Micro-Nikkor/dp/B000EOSHGQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1300137538&sr=1-1" title="105MM AF-S VR II F2.8D Micro Nikkor lens on Amazon">proper</a> macro lens, but it will hopefully allow me to take better close-up shots. That's the plan, anyway.</p>

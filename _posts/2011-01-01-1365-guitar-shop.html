<p>We went to Worcester today, had some lunch with Andy and Emma then went for a walk around the town. I found this lovely-looking guitar shop on Friar Street. It's just the sort of place I'd like to own in about 20 years. If I don't own a bookshop or cinema by then, that is.</p>

<p>Note to self: go back again when it's open.</p>

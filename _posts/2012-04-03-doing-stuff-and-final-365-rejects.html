title: Doing stuff, and final 365 rejects

<p>Now I've exhausted the stash of outtakes from last year, I'm considering starting another 365 project soon. Just have to make sure I enjoy it more this time and don't beat myself up so much about it. Some days will just be rubbish.</p>

<p>Going to do some work on the site soon too. That's all I've decided about that at the moment.</p>

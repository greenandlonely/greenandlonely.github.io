<p>Day 78 was a success, I'd say, and produced one of my favourites so far. This was taken just a short walk from my house at Reddicth Skate &amp; BMX park. There were loads of people there, and I got so many <em>almost great</em> photos of them mid-jump (including a few of them upside down, mid-flip), but they were all moving so quickly that they weren't completely in frame.</p>

<p>Honorable mention goes to the photo below that would have possibly been my photo for this day, except for the fact that I found it on the camera about a week too late.</p>

<p>Some of the guys wanted to see what pictures I took and they reliably informed me that they're <q>sick photos.</q> That means they liked them.</p>
<p>I'm sure I'll be heading back there a couple more times before the project is up.</p>

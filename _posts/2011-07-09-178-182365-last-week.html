<p>After a few positive comments from people I went into last week with a bit more confidence about taking photos. Well, enough for me to actually enjoy doing it, which is way better than the last few weeks.</p>

<p>Took Steph and her sister to a concert at Villa Park on Tuesday. While I was driving around waiting for it to finish I spotted this through some gates:</p>

<p>It was a scrap yard, in which the shells of cars were stacked on top of one-another, with their engines and other parts scattered around nearby. I went back on Wednesday to get a shot and luckily somebody actually let me in, which is how I managed to get close enough to get the photo above. My confidence boost really paid off here; a few months ago there's no way I'd have had the guts to ask a (rather scary-looking) stranger to let me into his premises.</p>

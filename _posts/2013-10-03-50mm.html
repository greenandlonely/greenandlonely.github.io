<p>I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nikon-AF-S-NIKKOR-50mm-1-4G/dp/B001GCVA0U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1380803635&sr=8-1&keywords=nikkor+50mm+1.4" title="Amazon page for Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.4G Lens">this lens</a> about 9 months ago, not long before I fell in love with the Fujifilm X100S. Going on holiday gave me a good reason to (briefly) pick up my Nikon again.</p>

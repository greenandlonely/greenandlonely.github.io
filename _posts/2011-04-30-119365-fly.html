<p>Got very lucky with this one; Steph and I were out for a quick walk and she just happened to notice it. I didn't have much time to think so I just took it and luckily it came out pretty well. Wish I could have got a bit closer but I was worried it would fly away.</p>

<p>Lemme know what you think...</p>

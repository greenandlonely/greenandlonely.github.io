<p>This is the first daily photo taken with my new DSLR. I'd originally bought a second-hand Nikon D70s, but when it arrived broken and completely unusable I decided to return that and go for a brand new D3100. In short, it's ace, although I haven't worked out how to get the best out of it yet. For now at least, hopefully these photos will be slightly better quality.</p>

<p>By the way, if anyone wants to buy me a new lens or two I'll be your friend forever. Or a new bag. Anything, I'm not fussy.</p>

<p>We found this frog in the garden on Monday night. It's quite resilliant, having survived being stepped on by Steph (it hopped under her foot just as she was stepping over it).</p>

<p>I love the colours in this photo, achieved by shining a torch as it hid in a corner, recovering from the foot.</p>

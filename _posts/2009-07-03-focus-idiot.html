<p>For the last few months I've found that, if left to my own devices, I haven't been able to concentrate on anything for long enough to actually get it done. No matter how much I want to achieve, within five minutes of starting I'll completely lose concentration and my mind will wander to other, much less important activities like checking email or watching crap on YouTube.</p>

<p>The worst thing is I don't exactly know why I do that, especially when there's so much I'd love to learn and experience. All I know is that my list of to-dos seems so long that to even arrange it into some sort of practical order is starting to look like a colossal task in itself. Of course, the longer I sit and moan about it, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, despite that, you might have noticed I've made a few additions to the site footer in the shape of a Twitter box and my Flickr photostream feed. Next up: styling and turning on comments. I'll be starting that next week, so expect it sometime in 2015.</p>

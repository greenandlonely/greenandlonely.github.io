<p>I love playing the guitar, but most of the time I need all the help I can get when it comes to learning new songs. Tabs are quite good, although I sometimes find them quite difficult to follow. It doesn't help that most of the tabs I find are seldom correct.</p>
<p>That's why I love <a title="Link to warrenmusic's YouTube page" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/warrenmusic">this man</a>. He films himself teaching near perfect renditions of Radiohead songs and posts the videos on YouTube for lazy/tab-illiterate people like me to learn. They're ideal for me because I pretty much only want to play Radiohead songs, and I'm always much better at learning something when it's demonstrated to me a couple of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">hundred</span> times.</p>
<p>I've recently been trying to tackle Jigsaw:</p>

<p>I came across this on day 88 and decided to go back to get it the day after (I can't really use the words <q>today</q> or <q>yesterday</q> when I'm writing these posts about 2 weeks after the photos were taken.)</p>

<p>I have no idea what's happened to the top of the picture - the edges of the roof have gone all jaggedy. It's probably something to do with me not knowing how to take a good picture.</p>

<p>I spent the weekend with my family at a hotel in Wiltshire to celebrate my Dad's 60th birthday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/greenandlonely/5586082770/" title="91/365 by jclarke0206, on Flickr"><img src="/assets/5586082770_35e8da6114.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="91/365" /></a></p>
<p>This is the best photo I got on the Friday. It's really noisy due to me shooting before setting the camera correctly, but, despite that, I quite like it.</p>

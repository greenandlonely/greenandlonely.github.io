<p>During the interval of Richard Herring's Christ on a Bike show at Huntingdon Hall in Worcester I managed to sneak my way into the gallery to snap this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/greenandlonely/5500325774/" title="63/365 by jclarke0206, on Flickr"><img src="/assets/5500325774_a52f56161d.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="63/365" /></a></p>
<p>Taken on my iPhone because stupid me forgot his camera.</p>

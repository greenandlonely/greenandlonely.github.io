<p>In other news, I've recently remembered how much I like <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Silent-Alarm-Bloc-Party/dp/B0006ZIDJO/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1304631338&sr=1-1" title="Silent Alarm by Bloc Party on Amazon">Silent Alarm</a> by Bloc Party. It's a bit too long, but when it's good, it's fantastic. Especially the drums.</p>

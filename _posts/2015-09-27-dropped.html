<p>As a way to encourage myself to keep taking pictures I was going to to do another <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/greenandlonely/albums/72157625721016426" title="365 project, 2001">daily photo project</a>, but that would have lasted 1 month at best. Instead, I'm going to do a weekly project, during which I'll post at least 1 photo per week to the blog. It's like a daily project, just 6/7 easier!</p>

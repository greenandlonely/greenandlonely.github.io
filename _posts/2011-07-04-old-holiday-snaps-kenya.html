<p>Some photos from our trip to Kenya in Autumn 2009. Can't remember which ones were taken by me and which are Steph's, so I'll take credit for them all.</p>
<p>These were taken with our old Canon Powershot, probably on Auto mode, before I knew anything about cameras and stuff. Despite that, I'm quite pleased with some of the results.</p>

<p>I only like this bottom one because it looks like he's got arms.</p>

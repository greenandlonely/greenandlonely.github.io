<p>I've come to the realisation that I'm not great at judging whether my photos are good or not. This becomes difficult when I get more than one that I'm happy with and I don't know which one to choose for my 365 project. I probably always pick the wrong one.</p>

<p>The photos below are a good example. I chose the top one, but now I'm beginning to think that's the worst of the three.</p>

<p>Let me know which one you'd have chosen. Also, tell me if you even think <em>any</em> of them are actually any good. Positive or negative feedback is always welcome; I'll just be happy to get comments that aren't from spambots.</p>

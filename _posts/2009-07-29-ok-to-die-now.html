<p>My organ donor card has arrived in the post. I have no idea why I wasn't already a registered donor, I'd just never really thought about it before. Now I <em>have</em> been thinking about it, to me, organ donation seems to be something people should have to opt out of, rather than the other way round.</p>
<p>If you feel the same, <a title="Find out how to become an organ donor" href="http://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/ukt/how_to_become_a_donor/how_to_become_a_donor.jsp">this is how to sign yourself up.</a></p>

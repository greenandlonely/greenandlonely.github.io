<p>I lost interest in this site quite a while ago, but I'm now back in a bit of a blogging mood so you can expect much more from me in 2011. This is mainly down to my deciding to embark on a 1-photo-a-day project type thing. I'll be posting all 365 photos here, so even if I don't write a lot, at least I'll be posting.</p>

<p>Speaking of photos...</p>

<p>I really wish I was a better photographer. I plan on getting better, which will involve reading interesting photography books (suggestions welcome) and hopefully buying a better camera (although with a move to Leamington Spa planned for some time in the next 18 months I can't really see that happening).</p>

<p>Happy Jesus party!</p>
